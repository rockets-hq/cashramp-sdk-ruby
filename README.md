gem install cashramp
```

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

```ruby
client = Cashramp::Client.initialize(env: :test, secret_key: 'test_key')

# Example: Fetch available countries
response = client.available_countries
# Check the response
if response.success?
  puts "Available countries: #{response.result}"
else
  puts "Error fetching available countries: #{response.error}"
end
```

## API Reference

## Custom Queries

For advanced use cases where the provided methods don't cover your specific needs, you can use the `sendRequest` method to send custom GraphQL queries:

```ruby
query = <<-GRAPHQL
  query GetAvailableCountries {
    availableCountries {
      code
      name
    }
  }
GRAPHQL

# Call the send_request method
response = client.send_request(name: 'availableCountries', query: query, variables: {})

# Check the response
if response.success?
  puts "Available countries: #{response.result}"
else
  puts "Error fetching available countries: #{response.error}"
end
```

## Error Handling

All methods in the gem return a response object with a `success` boolean. When `success` is `false`, an `error` property will be available with details about the error. Always check the `success` property before accessing the `result`.

## Documentation
